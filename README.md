# UptimeRobot-ExternalStatus
A clean self hosted status page which uses UptimeRobots API.

## Info
* This was the first project where I used Vue
* I am using the API which the official CName pages use with UptimeRobot.

## Installation
Drop the files onto a web server.<br>
Go to your standard (non-custom) URL and get the key - stats.uptimerobot.com/(urlKey)<br>
Replace the URL in api/config.php with the status page urlKey
