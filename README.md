# UptimeRobot-ExternalStatus
A self hosted status page which uses UptimeRobots API.

## Info
* This was the first project where I used Vue
* I am using the API which the official CName pages use with UptimeRobot.
* Per monitor details are not added _yet_

## Installation
Drop the files onto a web server.
Go to your current UptimeRobot status page and use Inspect Elements network tab to get the API
Replace the URL in api/status.php with the API URL you just got.
