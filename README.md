# UptimeRobot-ExternalStatus
A self hosted status page which uses UptimeRobots API.
I'm unsure if I am able to use the API which I am but it's the public one that they use for their CName pages.

Find the URL from the network tab on your own UptimeRobot page and put it in api/status.php (That's all the docs I'm giving.)
